Welcome!

This project is aimed at creating a simple to use,
user friendly, cross platform, file encryption tool
for the masses. The tool has two modes, simple mode
advanced mode. Both modes require the selection of
a file and a password to encrypt the file. Those
are the only fields that the simple mode requires.
By default, the simple mode encrypts with
AES-CBC-PKS5Padding with a 128 bit key. The
advanced mode offers a few more options, such as the
ability to encrypt triple des (DESede) along with a
stronger version of AES (256 bit key). This mode also
adds the key strength selection field and the Algo
type field.
